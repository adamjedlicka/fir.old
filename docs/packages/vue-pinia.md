# Vue Pinia

The `@fir-js/vue-pinia` adds support for the [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) state management library.

State changes on the server side during the initial render are automatically transfered to the browser so that browser state is exactly the same as was server state during HTML render.
